Netflix Data Analysis Dashboard
A Google Looker dashboard and data analysis project exploring the distribution of content on Netflix by language, genre, rating, and release year.

The primary goal of this project was to analyze a publicly available Netflix dataset to uncover key insights about its content library. By visualizing the data, I aimed to answer questions such as:

What is the language and genre distribution of content?

How has the volume of content changed over time?

What are the most common content ratings?

The dashboard provides a visual breakdown of the Netflix dataset through several key charts:

Content by Language: A pie chart showing the proportion of content based on its original and audio languages. This reveals the dominance of English and Hindi content on the platform.

Content by Genre: A detailed pie chart that breaks down the most popular genres, highlighting the diversity of content available.

Content by Rating: A clear visualization of the distribution of content by audience rating (e.g., U/A 7+, U, A).

Content Volume by Year: A bar chart tracking the number of titles released each year, illustrating content production trends over time.

Google Looker studio has been utilized for building this dashboard and the data was obtained from Kaggle.
